    "longDescription": "Used to manage up to 5 logical areas with up to 344 detector groups, of which 8 detector groups are integrated. Via the security bus S-Bus 1 zone modules, motion detectors and setting devices can be directly connected. The number of detector groups via the security bus S-Bus 1 is dependent on the current requirement (max. 800 mA) of the connected system components, cable length and cross-section. The security bus S-Bus 3 allows the connection for up to 5 keypads of the BT/A series. The KNX interface is used to exchange information of the whole system and allows operations via the KNX. An additional 128 detector groups can be integrated via KNX. The commissioning of the KNX is done via the ETS software. The network connection is used for parameterization, operation and display via the existing web server. The panel possesses 4 outputs for signal encoders and 4 outputs for potential-free switching (12...24 V DC/AC). The integrated modem is used for private remote alarms using spoken messages, text messages (SMS-Center) and e-mail. In addition, a system interface (ATS) allows the connection of an external ABB transmission device of the comXline series, for connection to a security company. It is possible to connect 2x18 Ah rechargeable batteries as critical power for up to 60 hours, in accordance with VdS, DIN EN and ISO/IEC. The device can be used in systems with increased security requirements according to VdS Class A, B and C, DIN VDE 0833 Level 1, 2 and 3 and EN 50 131 / IEC 62 642 Level 1, 2 and 3.",
