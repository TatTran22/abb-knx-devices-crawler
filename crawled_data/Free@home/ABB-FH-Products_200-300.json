With integrated universal dimming actuator for controlling LEDs, incandescent lamps, 230 V halogen lamps, low-voltage halogen lamps with conventional or electronic transformers, and dimmable energy-saving halogen lamps. For dimmable Retrofit-LEDs (LEDi). Dimming function is available also without prior programming (pre-configured). Configuration can be changed later via the web interface (groups, scenes, etc.). For contacting 1gang rocker 6230-10-xxx, 6231-10-xxx, 6232-10-xxx, 6233-10-xxx und 6234-10-xxx. 2-wire connection (neutral conductor not required) 3-wire connection technology is possible as an option for improved load behaviour (for details see the online operating manual). With 230 V extension unit input (dimming brighter/darker, switching). With fixing claws.",
